      <strong>Proposal</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Link to proposal (preferably in a github repository). You should have at
      least an unofficial proposal in hand and/or have discussed the API within
      the Web Incubator Community Group (WICG) before sending an intent to
      migrate. If your proposal is not yet at this stage of maturity, feel free
      to solicit feedback informally on discourse instead. You may be asked to
      create a github repository if there isn't one.
    </p>
    <p id='summary'>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Give a high-level description of your proposal.
    </p>
    <p id='motivation'>
      <strong>Motivation and Use Cases</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Explain why the web needs this change. It may be useful to describe what
      web developers are forced to do without it. Include links to back up your
      claims, including data.
    </p>
    <p id='risk'>
      <strong>Compatibility Risk</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please characterize how much we might regret standardizing this new
      feature were we to change or remove it in the future. If you donâ€™t have a
      github repository, include in this email links to relevant discussions,
      or documentation about support for the feature on the Web.
    </p>
    <p id='constraints'>
      <strong>Ongoing technical constraints</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      What technical constraints will be added to user agents implementing this
      feature?
    </p>
    <p id='device_independence'>
      <strong>Will this feature be supported in all environments (desktop,
      mobile, tablets, TV, eBooks, automotive, etc.)?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes or no. If no, explain why certain user agents will not be included in
      your implementation.
    </p>
    <p id='implementations'>
      <strong>Link to implementation experience and demos</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If your proposal has implementation experience or demos, please provide
      links, including common patterns in deployed libraries. Otherwise,
      indicate if there are none.
    </p>
    <p id='data'>
      <strong>Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      What data do you have available that indicates that this enhancement will
      affect many users of the Web. Quantify the fraction of websites that are
      currently using something similar to this feature. Or, if a new feature,
      characterize the reason that you expect this to be far reaching.
    </p>
    <p id='security'>
      <strong>Security and Privacy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Outline the <a href=
      'https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/'>security and privacy
      implications</a> of your proposal for end-users. Otherwise, indicate if
      there are none.
    </p>
    <p id='a11y'>
      <strong>Accessibility</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Outline the <a href=
      'https://github.com/stevefaulkner/accessibility-spec-questionnaire/blob/master/accessibility-spec-questionnaire.md'>
      implications of your proposal</a> relative to access by everyone
      regardless of disability. Otherwise, indicate if there are none.
    </p>
    <p id='i18n'>
      <strong>Internationalization</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Outline the implications of your proposal when used with different
      languages, scripts, and cultures. Otherwise, indicate if there are none.
