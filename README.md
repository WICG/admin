## Current Proposals

None yet. See below for how to make one!

### Contributing New Proposals

**Please [join the WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/) before submitting new proposals.**

 1. **State the problem**: Write a description of a limitation with the Web platform and either post it to <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a>, spin up a GitHub repo, or just publish it somewhere (e.g., blog post, gist, whatever you like). This should be something you believe is missing in the platform and would make the lives of developers significantly easier if it were added. It can also be something you've noticed is a recurring development pattern which would benefit from standardization.
 1.**Join the group**: Before bringing the above to the group's attention, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">join the community group</a>, which means you agree with the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C's Community Contributor License Agreement</a> (CLA). It's critical if you first <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">join the group</a> or else key members won't be able to review or discuss your proposal. Don't worry if you forget, the Chairs will remind you and hound you till you do :)
 1. **Evaluation**: As a community, we will evaluate if the problem can't be solved already using Web tech. We will also look at how many users of the Web might be affected. This will require collecting data, real world usage examples, etc.
 1. **Use cases**: If need be, we will formalize the above into a use cases document. Such a document can help prove to the community that there is indeed a need for a solution that needs standardization (see the <a href="https://usecases.responsiveimages.org/">Use Cases and Requirements for Standardizing Responsive Images</a>, for example).
 1. **Advocate**: We circulate this with browser vendors and the community at large—we pitch it to anyone who will listen. Getting everyone on-board and in our corner is critical.
 1. **Specify it**: Once we have buy-in from browser vendors and the community, we put together some rough proposals (e.g., a new HTML element, API, or HTTP header...) and we do an "<a href="http://w3c.github.io/charter-html/request-to-transition.html">intent to migrate</a>": where we move the spec to a W3C Working group to seek royalty free licensing commitments from W3C members (you know, the "free" in "free and open").
 1. **(Bonus points) Implementation**: Help turn the ideas from words on paper into working features in modern browsers.
