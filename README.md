## Current Proposals

Proposals are visible at the organization level (see [all the WICG repositories](https://github.com/WICG/)).

### Contributing New Proposals
The following is given as guidance. It's is not a requirement for starting work on a proposal.

**Please [join the WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/) before submitting new proposals.**

 1. **Join the group**: Before bringing the above to the group's attention, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">join the community group</a>, which means you agree with the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C's Community Contributor License Agreement</a> (CLA). It's critical if you first <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">join the group</a> or else key members won't be able to review or discuss your proposal.
 1. **State the problem, make a rough proposal**: Write an informal description of a limitation with the Web platform and post it to <a href="http://discourse.wicg.io/">Discourse</a>. This should be something you believe is missing in the platform and would make the lives of developers significantly easier if it were added. It can also be something you've noticed is a recurring development pattern which would benefit from standardization. If you have a rough proposal for a solution, spinning up a public GitHub repo from your own account is probably the best way to disseminate it.  It's fine if your proposal is totally rough and informal - include code examples, diagrams, or whatever you think helps explain the problem best.  Be sure to examine use cases.  This can be informally in the Discourse post, or a short document in the repo. Such a document can help prove to the community that there is indeed a need for a solution that needs standardization (see the <a href="https://usecases.responsiveimages.org/">Use Cases and Requirements for Standardizing Responsive Images</a>, for example).
 1. **Evaluation**: As a community, we will use Discourse to evaluate interest and ask for potential editors for the proposal.  As soon as sufficient interest is shown in the discourse (notably from potential implementers), the WICG chairs will enable a team of editors to manage the proposal (based on the discourse), and those team members can move ownership of the GitHub repo (if any) to WICG.  (We will expect all previous contributions to the proposal to have been made by WICG members, or will need explicit CLAs from other contributors - ask the chairs for assistance if needed.)  
 1. **Editing and Refinement**: The community should incubate and refine the proposal, through discussion on GitHub issues on the repo (and Discourse, if appropriate) until they feel the proposal has sufficient support and resolution to move to an appropriate Working Group; at that point, the editing team should contact the chairs, and the chairs will help do an "<a href="http://w3c.github.io/charter-html/request-to-transition.html">intent to migrate</a>": where we move the spec to a W3C Working group to seek royalty free licensing commitments from W3C members (you know, the "free" in "free and open").
 1. **(Bonus points) Implementation**: Help turn the ideas from words on paper into working features in modern browsers.

## Code of Conduct

As a W3C Community Group, the WICG operates under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

### Statement of Intent

W3C is committed to maintain a **positive** work environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where [participants][Participant] at all levels **behave** according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that **we all share responsibility** for our [work environment][Work].

### Code

 1. Treat each other with [respect][], professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.

 1. Never [discriminate][Discrimination] on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
 1. Communicate constructively and avoid [demeaning][] or [insulting][] behavior or language.
 1. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and [acknowledge][Acknowledgement] properly the contributions of others.
 1. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to [conflicts of interest][].
 1. Respect the [privacy][Confidentiality] of others and the [confidentiality][] of data you access.
 1. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair behavior.
 1. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a [leadership position][Leadership]) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.
